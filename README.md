## Context
Machine Learning is a subset of the larger field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on teaching computers how to learn without the need to be programmed for specific tasks. In fact, the key idea behind ML is that it is possible to create algorithms that learn from and make predictions on the data.

But before applying Machine Learning on any dataset, you need to convert it in such a way that the algorithms could understand the dataset. These steps are preprocessing steps.
